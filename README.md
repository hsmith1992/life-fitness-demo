# Shopify Nuxt

A starter template kit for those looking to use Shopify's new Cart API with Nuxt.js.

Ensure you set the environment variables to point to your Shopify storefront api:
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN
SHOPIFY_API_ENDPOINT

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install / npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev / npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build / npm run build
$ yarn start / npm run start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate / npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
